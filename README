Tubes is a node.js web server framework in the form of a DSL. It is 
NOT intended for production use, but rather as a quick hack to 
demonstrate the potential for JavaScript to be, not just a viable 
choice, but the optimal choice, of a server language.

From a technological viewpoint, Tubes is inspired by jQuery, Django,
and Rails. From a less-technological viewpoint, it was inspired by
the late senator Ted Stevens. Tubes upholds Mr. Stevens' famous words
by having the programmer define a web server as a series of tubes.

A simple server that serves static files can be defined by:

tubes('files', '/').connect().toDirectory('./static/');

Doing things manually is easy as well:

tubes('form', '/form').connect().to({
	get: toTemplate('formtemplate.html'),
	post: function (request, response, complete) {
		this.formData(function (data) {
			new MyModel(data).save(function () {
				complete();
			});
		});
	}
})
